Abstract: *We present a novel LSTM cell architecture capable of Multi-Perspective LSTM (MP-LSTM) cell architecture learning both intra- and inter-perspective relationships available in visual sequences captured from multiple perspectives. Our architecture adopts a novel recurrent joint learning strategy that uses additional gates and memories at the cell level. We demonstrate that by using the proposed cell to create a network, more effective and richer visual representations are learned for recognition tasks. We validate the performance of our proposed architecture in the context of two multi-perspective visual recognition tasks namely lip reading and face recognition. Three relevant datasets are considered and the results are compared against fusion strategies, other existing multi-input LSTM architectures, and alternative recognition solutions. The experiments show the superior performance of our solution over the considered benchmarks, both in terms of recognition accuracy and computational complexity.*
